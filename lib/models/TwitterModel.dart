abstract class Tweet{} // This is an Abstract class
///An abstract class like this will allow us create a type of tweet.
/// This will allow us to know what kind of tweet is being entered by our user.
/// Such that if a tweet contains only 1 image, we would know how to display it,
/// and if a tweet contains 3 Tweets, we would also have a different view
/// properly defined to handle 3 tweets and so on.
/// Now we are going to create 5 other classes that will implement our abstract class
/// just like described above.

///Ideally we would want to pass a "user" class to all the classes below
///But instead we will just use variables inorder to keep this less complex,
/// and the classes as independent as possible.

/// This class below will handle tweets with only text and no image
